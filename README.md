# Kaggle - Classification

"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." -- George Santayana

This is a compiled list of Kaggle competitions and their winning solutions for [classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification) problems. 

The purpose to complie this list is for easier access and therefore learning from the best in data science.

Literature review is a crucial yet sometimes overlooked part in data science. To avoid reinventing the wheels and get inspired on how to preprocess, engineer, and model the data, it's worth spend 1/10 to 1/5 of the project time just researching how people deal with similar problems/datasets.

Time spent on literature review is time well spent.

This is only one list of the whole compilation. For other lists of competitions and solutions, please refer to:

* Kaggle - [Regression](https://github.com/ShuaiW/kaggle-regression/)
* Kaggle - [Sequence](https://github.com/ShuaiW/kaggle-sequence)
* Kaggle - [Image](https://github.com/ShuaiW/kaggle-image)
* Kaggle - [Miscellaneous](https://github.com/ShuaiW/kaggle-miscellaneous)

Hope the compilation can save you efforts and offer you insights. Enjoy!
